# Credit Card Spending Analysis: India
This project aims to analyze credit card spending patterns in various cities across India based on transaction data. The analysis provides insights into how credit cards are used, the distribution of expenses, and spending trends over time.

## Project Structure
- Data Cleaning: The initial step involves preprocessing the dataset, including removing unnecessary columns, extracting date components, and categorizing purchase amounts.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The EDA phase includes visualizations to better understand the data. It encompasses analyses of card types, expense types, gender distribution, and monthly spending patterns.

- Insights and Visualizations: Various plots such as count plots, box plots, and violin plots are used to visualize and interpret the data. These visualizations offer insights into spending behavior and trends.

## Dataset
- The dataset, available in the file Credit card transactions - India - Simple.csv, includes the following columns:
- City: The city where the transaction occurred.
- Date: The date of the transaction.
- Card Type: The type of credit card used.
- Exp Type: The expense type (e.g., bills, groceries).
- Gender: The gender of the credit card holder.
- Amount: The transaction amount.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

## The code includes the following steps:
- Importing necessary libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- Reading the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Dropping the index column.
- Extracting day, month, and year from the 'Date' column.
- Creating a function to classify purchase prices into categories based on the 'Amount' column.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## The EDA involves visualizations such as:
- Count plot of card types.
- Count plot of expense types.
- Count plot of expense types by gender.
- Count plot of card types by gender.
- Box plot and bar plot showing monthly spending patterns.
- Violin plot showing spending patterns by card type.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
- Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook


## Key Findings
- Monthly Spending Patterns: The analysis revealed varying spending patterns across different months, shedding light on the seasonality of expenses.
- Expense Categories: Categorization of purchase amounts allowed for a better understanding of spending behaviors, enabling targeted strategies for financial planning and budgeting.
- Card Usage and Preferences: Insights into the usage of different card types and expense categories provided valuable information for credit card providers and advertisers.
## Future Prospects
This analysis serves as a foundational exploration of credit card spending habits. Future iterations and expansions of this project could include predictive modeling to forecast spending trends, regional comparisons, and deeper demographic analyses.
By leveraging this analysis, individuals can make informed financial decisions, while businesses can tailor their services to better meet the needs and preferences of their customers.
