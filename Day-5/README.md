# Data Analysis Challenge - Day 5: Analyzing Twitter Stock Data ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview
Welcome to Day 5 of my 30-day Data Analysis Challenge! In this segment, I explored and analyzed Twitter's stock data using various time series analysis techniques. The goal was to gain insights into the daily closing prices and build a predictive ARIMA model to forecast future stock prices.

## Key Highlights
## Data Preparation:
Imported the Twitter stock data and inspected the first few rows to understand the structure.
Checked for missing values and ensured data cleanliness.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Visualized daily closing prices to grasp stock trends and patterns.
- Utilized a scatter plot to observe the distribution of closing prices.

## Statistical Analysis:
- Determined stationarity by calculating rolling mean and standard deviation.
- Applied seasonal decomposition to separate trends and seasonality from the data.
Modeling:

- Created a log-transformed series to reduce magnitude and trends.
- Calculated the rolling mean and standard deviation.
- Split the data into training and testing sets for ARIMA model implementation.

## ARIMA Model:
- Leveraged the AutoARIMA model to find optimal parameters for ARIMA modeling.
- Trained the ARIMA model on the training data and forecasted future stock prices.
  
## Next Steps
Refine the ARIMA model by tweaking parameters and fine-tuning.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Consider exploring more advanced time series analysis techniques for deeper insights.
Stay tuned for the upcoming days of this challenge, where I plan to delve into advanced modeling and gain even deeper insights into this intriguing dataset!
