# Movies EDA and Analysis

## Overview
This project involves an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and analysis of movie data. The dataset contains information about movies including their names, year of release, category, runtime, genre, IMDB rating, votes, and gross earnings.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from 'movies.csv' and includes the following columns:
- `movie_name`: The name of the movie
- `year_of_release`: The year the movie was released
- `category`: The category of the movie
- `run_time`: The runtime of the movie in minutes
- `genre`: The genre(s) of the movie
- `imdb_rating`: The IMDB rating of the movie
- `votes`: The number of votes the movie received
- `gross_total`: The gross earnings of the movie

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
The dataset underwent preprocessing to ensure consistency and appropriate data types. This involved:
- Cleaning the 'year_of_release', 'votes', and 'gross_total' columns
- Converting certain columns to appropriate data types for analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA involved understanding and visualizing various aspects of the dataset, including:
- Most common movie categories and genres
- Distribution of IMDB ratings
- Top 10 movies by gross earnings
- Runtime distribution in different categories and genres
- Gross earnings trends over the years

## Visualization
The visualizations were created using popular data visualization libraries such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly Express.
